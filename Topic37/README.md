# Websockets, Long Polling , SSE


## Websockets

Opens a Bidirectional TCP connection Open , for client and server to send and receive messages , the communication is bidirectional and stateful. The client and server can exchange information at any given time



## Long Polling
a server to client connection are held open for as long as possible, and delivers a response when new data becomes available or if a timeout threshold is reached. This is a bit diffrent from websocket in the sense that in long polling , response to a request is only being sent.
