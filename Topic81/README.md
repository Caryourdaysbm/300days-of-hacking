### Mac IPC

Mach IPC
It enables tasks (processes) to exchange information through ports asynchronously. Main components:

- Ports: Kernel-managed communication channels, similar to pipes.

- Port Rights: Permissions that control how processes can interact with ports (via handles).

- Messages: Structured data units exchanged between ports.

- Service: A named port registered with the bootstrap server.

- Bootstrap Server: A service (typically launchd) responsible for service registration and discovery.

```c
// Process A (Server/ Task with recieve right, attach send right to port for bootstrap) 
mach_port_t server_port;

// Create port with RECEIVE right
kern_return_t kr = mach_port_allocate(
    mach_task_self(),                  // our task
    MACH_PORT_RIGHT_RECEIVE,           // want receive right
    &server_port                       // port name to create
);

// Create SEND right
mach_port_insert_right(
    mach_task_self(),                  // our task
    server_port,                       // port
    server_port,                       // same port 
    MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND            // convert to send right
);

// Register with launchd
bootstrap_check_in(
    bootstrap_port,                    // launchd port
    "com.example.service",             // service name
    server_port                        // port with send right
);

// Process B (Client/ Task that obtains send right from bootstrap) 
mach_port_t client_port;
bootstrap_look_up(
    bootstrap_port,                    // launchd port
    "com.example.service",             // service name
    &client_port                       // receives send right
);
```

# MAC Message Header 

```
typedef struct {
  mach_msg_bits_t       msgh_bits;
  mach_msg_size_t       msgh_size;
  mach_port_t           msgh_remote_port;
  mach_port_t           msgh_local_port;
  mach_port_name_t      msgh_voucher_port;
  mach_msg_id_t         msgh_id;
} mach_msg_header_t;
```

A brief description of these fields is the following:
- msgh_bits - options and message metadata, such as disposition of port rights in the message
- msgh_size - total message size, including header
- msgh_remote_port - remote Mach port, used as the destination when sending a message, or a reply port when receiving
- msgh_local_port - local Mach port, the port the message was received on, or a reply port when sending a message
- msgh_voucher_port - port identifying a Mach Voucher, thatâ€™s an optional field
- msgh_id - user defined message identifier
