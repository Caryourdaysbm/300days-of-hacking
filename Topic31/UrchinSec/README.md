## 1. Challenge - By Polar RSA 
##### Points: 250

A python file and a file containing the ciphertext were provided.

The python code shows how the encryption was done. There are 3 functions as shown below, The first fuction generates a prime number, the second function (g_rsa_pair) generates the key pair given a key size, and the last function does the encryption.


```python
from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime as gp , bytes_to_long as btl
import random as rd
import sympy.ntheory as nt

def g_prime(bit_length):
    return gp(bit_length)

def g_rsa_pair(bit_length):
    p = g_prime(bit_length)
    q = nt.nextprime(p)
    x, y = 1337, 5000
    for _ in range(rd.randint(x, y)):
        q = nt.nextprime(q)
    N = p * q
    phi_N = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
    e = 65537
    d = pow(e, -1, phi_N)  
    public_key = (N, e)
    private_key = (N, d)
    return public_key, private_key # N, e     N,d

def enryption(message, public_key):
    N, e = public_key
    pt = btl(message.encode())
    ct = pow(pt, e, N)
    return ct

bit_length = 1024
print("start")
print(g_rsa_pair(bit_length))
public_key, _ = g_rsa_pair(bit_length)
print(public_key)
msg = "urchinsec{Fake_Flag}"
ciphertext = enryption(msg, public_key)
print(f"n: {public_key[0]}")
print(f"e: {public_key[1]}")
print(f"cipher: {ciphertext}")
```

#### **Solution :**

Examining the Python file, my attention was directed towards the process of generating the RSA key pair.


```python
def g_rsa_pair(bit_length):
    p = g_prime(bit_length)
    q = nt.nextprime(p)
    x, y = 1337, 5000
    for _ in range(rd.randint(x, y)):
        q = nt.nextprime(q)
    N = p * q
    phi_N = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
    e = 65537
    d = pow(e, -1, phi_N)  
    public_key = (N, e)
    private_key = (N, d)
    return public_key, private_key # N, e     N,d

```
Looking closely at the generation process of p and q:

The get_prime() function is utilized to obtain a prime number, p. Subsequently, q is generated through the expression "q = nt.nextprime(p)", Reading the library documentation of nextprime function (<a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/ntheory.html#sympy.ntheory.generate.nextprime">here</a>), It says the function generates the next prime number greater than the argunment given to it, as p was the argument supplied to it, we can see that the next couple of prime numbers after p was assigned to q. from here we can deduce that the diffrence between p and q is negligible.

Now, where is the problem in that you may ask? RSA encryption algorithm relies on the fact that factorization of large numbers is a very hard problem. In our own case, two prime numbers were chosen p, q, the multiplication of both numbers was made publicly assessible, N=p*q, the security of this encryption algorithm is the fact that given N, we will find it impossible to generate p and q without bruteforcing a large bit space. However, vulnerable implementations of this could lead to it being broken, one of the occurence is in situations where p and q are really close as in our case here, This can lead to the public key being broken with Fermat factorization algorithm. 

Lets look at fermat method of factorizing N, Fermat says the product of two large primes can always be written as N=(a-b)(a+b), with a being the middle between the two primes and b the distance from the middle to each of the primes.
If the primes are close then a is close to the square root of N. This allows guessing the value a by starting with the square root of N and then incrementing the guess by one each round.
For each guess we can calculate b^2 = a^2 - N. If the result is a square we know we have guessed a correctly. From this we can calculate p=a+b and q=a-b. Hence get back p and q.


### Factorizing N using farmat equatiom

```py
import gmpy2

N = 13660434380581469341975259828359442143257638335184201302273368295115642264434078009719568658893902099636280367748794936198883121916566759980319478068451889149773226303724397129080256671084001239425357663205345604232700769511136087038814886708523857954047161710079081105648157438922135347302268392557280337962501293170357378150549402374842219641781167567899043267569898951833055690878240668548807574813621152068811079565478546974052540054707402886449015640286146318337170863094022162781259688095263640720121736648132174258723707789668493418719055328110579315482197651253358684859047225130074022770557785786256404214699

def fermat_factor(n):
    assert n % 2 != 0

    a = gmpy2.isqrt(n)
    b2 = gmpy2.square(a) - n

    while not gmpy2.is_square(b2):
        a += 1
        b2 = gmpy2.square(a) - n

    p = a + gmpy2.isqrt(b2)
    q = a - gmpy2.isqrt(b2)

    return int(p), int(q)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    (p, q) = fermat_factor(N)



```
Hence our p and q, after which  can do the decryption as:


```py
cipher = 999999
d = (p-1)(q-1)
e = 65537
dec = pow(cipher, d , e)

```







## 2. Challenge -Honey Sea
##### Points: 250


The python code given shows how the ciphertext encryption was implemented, it shows the key and iv generated randomly and the flag encrypted. the ciphertext was written to a file alongside the IV and the signature

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad
import os
import binascii

def generate_key():
    return os.urandom(16)

def generate_iv():
    return os.urandom(16)

def encrypt_flag(flag, key, iv):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    encrypted = cipher.encrypt(pad(flag.encode(), 16))
    return encrypted

def generate_signature(iv, key):
    signature_bytes = [a ^ b for a, b in zip(iv, key[::-1])]
    signature_hex = binascii.hexlify(bytearray(signature_bytes)).decode()
    return signature_hex

def encrypt_flag_with_signature(flag, key, iv):
    encrypted_data = encrypt_flag(flag, key, iv)
    signature = generate_signature(iv, key)
    iv_hex = iv.hex()[4:] 
    encrypted_hex = encrypted_data.hex()
    ciphertext = iv_hex + encrypted_hex + signature
    return {"cipher": ciphertext}

def main():
    FLAG = "urchinsec{Fake_Flag}"
    KEY = generate_key()
    IV = generate_iv()

    encrypted_flag = encrypt_flag_with_signature(FLAG, KEY, IV)
    print(encrypted_flag)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

#### **Solution :**

Walking back,  we can see the "encrypt_flag_with_signature()" takes in three arguments: The flag, Key and the Randomly generated IV. The encryption function produced a ciphertext which was written as the combination of  "iv_hex + encrypted_hex + signature". 
The vulnerability in this code arises from how the signature was generated, as the signature is the XOR of the IV and the key, two of which were provided in the ciphertext.

since,

signature = iv + key

To generate the key, we just have to xor the signature and the IV that was given with the ciphertext. 

i.e key = iv + signature

Once the key is generated, we can easily decrypt the ciphertext

The only issue here is the IV we have has its first two bytes removed on this line. 

```py
iv_hex = iv.hex()[4:]
```

To generate the full IV, I had to bruteforce the first two bytes, given the lenght of the bruteforce is negligible we have nothing to worry about. Now to decryption, First I extracted the IV, signature and encrypted flag, then generated the key by xoring the IV with the signature while bruteforcing the first two bytes and checking if it decrypts the flag.

```py
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad
import os
import binascii
import itertools


ciphertext = '888fb84744ea0ea84165cf6418b07bd829cc2a695e7d5bb4acdae1179bac51f02486993c80c028b3350029c171819ad9166b78e998c87be7233a302b83f0ebe67f4684682c4b3798f42587173965'


iv = ciphertext[:28]


signature = ciphertext[-32:]


encrypted = ciphertext[28:len(ciphertext)-32]

assert(iv+encrypted+signature==ciphertext)


byte_values = [format(i, '02X') for i in range(256)]


def generate_signature(iv, signature):
    signature_bytes = bytes(bytearray([a ^ b for a, b in zip(iv, signature)]))
    
    return signature_bytes[::-1]


combinations = itertools.product(byte_values, repeat=2)

result = [''.join(combination) for combination in combinations]

for num in result:
	iv_bytes = bytes.fromhex(num + iv)
	signature_bytes = binascii.unhexlify(signature)

	key = generate_signature(iv_bytes, signature_bytes)
	
	cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv_bytes)
	encrypted_flag = bytes.fromhex(encrypted)
	try:
		decrypted = unpad(cipher.decrypt(encrypted_flag), 16)
		if b"urchinsec" in decrypted:
			print(key)
			print(decrypted.decode())
	except:
		continue

```

            padded_data = compressed_data + b' ' * (16 - len(compressed_data) % 16)
            ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(padded_data)

            with open(self.zip_output, "wb") as output_file:
                output_file.write(salt)
                output_file.write(iv)
                output_file.write(ciphertext)
            
            return f"{self.file_to_zip} is zipped into {self.zip_output}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error : {e}"

```

#### **Solution :**


To solve this challenge we have to understand how the python program generated its zip, this way we can reverse the algorithm and solve the challenge. 
First a salt of 16bytes was generated, then a random  initialization vector of 16 bytes was also generated, after which a password hash of 32 bytes was generated with the a key supplied by the user who generated the hash. The algorithm proceeded to encrypt the padded compressed input file with AES CBC, and finally write the Salt, IV and Ciphertext into a file.

Reversing this, I began by reading the bytes in the sequence they were originally written to the file, then I had to generate the key(pass hash) from the password with the salt I extracted from file, after which I decrypted the file and striped the padded space before decompressing with zlib.

```python
    def decrypt_zip_file(self):


        with open(self.zip_output, "rb") as input_file:
            salt = input_file.read(16)
            iv = input_file.read(16)
            ciphertext = input_file.read()

        

        key = PBKDF2(self.password, salt, dkLen=32, count=1000000)

        

        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

        plain_padded = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext).strip(b" ")

        return zlib.decompress(plain_padded)
```

The issue here is there was no password given with the challenge file, I faced some difficulties until a hint directed me to inspect "rockyou.txt," a file containing a vast dictionary of millions of passwords.


```py

def brute_force_attack(wordlist_path):

    with open(wordlist_path, "r") as wordlist:

        for password in wordlist:

            password = password.strip()

            zip_object = SantaZip("flag.txt", "flag.zip", password)

            try:

                print(zip_object.decrypt_zip_file())
            except Exception as e:
                
                continue

                # print(zip_object.generate_zip_file())


brute_force_attack("/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt")

```
